## used Alex as placeholder player name##

Once upon a time, in the mystical realm of Eldoria where birds sore high above the clouds, a courageous adventurer named Alex embarked on a journey to find a hidden treasure of unimaginable power.
Alex's heart thumped with excitement and trepidation as he set foot into the Enchanted Grove, guided by the tales of his late mentor, a legendary explorer.
But beneath Alex's brave facade lay a deep motivation - a burning desire to prove himself worthy and honor his mentor's legacy.
As he ventured deeper into the Grove, he encountered a mischievous fairy named Luna. Luna presented a riddle that guarded the path to the treasure.
"Two sisters I have, united yet apart,
One brings light, the other dark.
Through the whispering wind, their voices ring,
Find the answer, and treasures you shall bring."
Can you solve the riddle and proceed? (y/n): 
Unsure of the answer, you retreat from the Enchanted Grove.
Your quest ends here, and the treasure remains forever hidden.
Impressed by your wisdom, Luna opens a hidden passageway.
You find yourself in the heart of the Enchanted Grove, surrounded by ancient trees and shimmering lights.
A pathway splits into two directions: the Path of Illumination and the Path of Shadows. Which path will you choose? 
You walk along the Path of Illumination, where beams of sunlight guide your way.
As you proceed, you encounter a shimmering pool with a golden fish swimming within. The fish speaks with a melodious voice, offering you a cryptic choice. "To reach the treasure's embrace, answer me this: In Eldoria, what creature soars high above the clouds?" What is your answer? (bird/fish/dragon): 
The golden fish nods in approval and grants you passage.
The water ripples in disappointment, and you find yourself back at the crossroads.
You navigate the treacherous Path of Shadows, shrouded in darkness.
Glowing eyes watch you from the depths, and an eerie whisper fills the air. A mysterious voice poses a riddle that guards the path ahead. "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?" What is your answer? (wind/fire/water): 
The shadows part, and the path clears before you.
The whisper fades into silence, and you find yourself back at the crossroads.
You arrive in the ancient chamber that houses the Eldorian treasure.
Before you lies a magnificent chest, radiating with an otherworldly glow. The chest demands a final decision to unlock its secrets. "What is the true essence of an adventurer? Will you accept the responsibility that comes with this power?" Do you accept? (y/n): 
As you affirm your acceptance, the chest opens with a blinding light.
You have proven your worth, and the power of the Eldorian treasure is bestowed upon you.
Congratulations! You have triumphed in your quest and unlocked a new destiny in Eldoria.
Hesitant to bear the burden, you step back from the chest.
The treasure fades away, leaving you with a sense of longing and unfinished business.
